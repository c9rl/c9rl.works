            I attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the Fall of 2009 with the intent to be an International
            Business and Japanese double major. I took a variety of courses from calculus/analytical geometry and
            Asian-American history to economics and poetry during my Freshman year. I was accepted into the
            business school, but instead decided to pursue a B.S. in Economics thanks to Paul Krugman's enlightening textbook.
            If you didn't find me studying in the basement of Steenbock Library or at a table at <a

            you could find me speaking Japanese at ‰ºöË©±„ÅÆ‰ºö in Memorial Union or tutoring other students on how
            to draw supply/demand curves in the business school atrium.

            In 2010, I interned at Central Japan Railways (JR Central), Japan's highest throughput high-speed-rail
            operator (that's a fancy way of saying their most popular train company). I lived in a little apartment
            near Shinagawa Station in Tokyo for 3 months during that summer and conducted field work analyzing JR Central's
            marketing strategies and ridership/throughput. I eventually presented my research to their int'l division in Japanese.
            The following summer I participated in Capital One's Summit for Developing Leaders, a one-week intensive case study competition,
            where my team placed 2nd and took home some sweet <i>vintage</i> iPod Shuffles as our prize.

            University</a> in Tokyo (go Unicorns - <i>seriously</i>, their mascot is a Unicorn) as a Monbukagakusho
            Scholar. During that year, I built my proficiency in Level 9 of Keio's Japanese Language Program, passed N2
            of the JLPT, and played on one of Keio's intramural basketball teams. I also spent a lot of time traveling
            around Japan, especially obscure areas like Yakushima, Mt. Aso, and Takayama.

          <p>
            In May 2013, I walked across the stage in the Kohl Center to receive my diploma holder (the real diploma
            came in the mail a few weeks later) for a B.S. in Economics, Japanese, and East Asian Studies
            after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egmgt5Y-7bQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this workaholic</a> gave

            After graduating, I moved to the East Coast and worked as an Associate Consultant
            at <a href="https://www.thefrontierproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Frontier Project</a>, a
            boutique consulting firm located in Richmond, VA. During my time there, I designed training programs that
            made use of Behavioral Economics to incentivize human behavior and made data-driven recommendations for
            client projects. I began building tools to support my data analysis and taking on web-based projects. My
            role shifted from business facing activities to creating web applications for our clients using JavaScript/jQuery,
            PHP, and Ruby. It was here that I really started to cultivate my desire to work and build a product through
            coding.

            While working remote for The Frontier Project on some smaller web projects, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MakerSquare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I continued to grow my coding

            of which was even recognized by Yelp</a>. After 2 years of working at The Frontier Project, I left for the
            opportunity to be Software Engineer #10 and work on building out <a href="https://my.socialnative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the web
            application</a> of a data-first ad startup,
            which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/18/social-native-raises-8-million-to-build-a-new-social-media-ad-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised an $8M seed round</a> during

          <p>
            <a href="http://socialnative.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Native</a> helped brands connect with
            consumers by creating 1:1 personalized content on demand. As a Software Engineer there, I worked across the stack,
            building services for our internal API and integrating with third-party platforms such as Typeform and
            Filestack for data collection and file uploads to building out internal, brand, and creator-facing features
            on our platform. We used a mix of MySQL, Elasticsearch, and Redis for our data storage, Node.js/Koa.js for
            our API, PHP/Laravel for routing/controller actions, and React/Redux for our view layer. We did unit,
            integration, and functional testing using Mocha/Chai, Enzyme and Selenium/Nightwatch.js, and had >80% test
            coverage across our projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            After Social Native, I decided to follow my curiosity and started pursuing a Master of Science in Computer
            Science at <a href="http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgia Tech (OMSCS)</a> with
            a specialization in Machine Learning. I also took some time to travel to Seattle, WA and Austin, TX. Oh, and I ran
            my first half-marathon (2:37:49) in San Diego.
          </p>
          <p>
            While continuing my studies at Georgia Tech, I worked remotely for a company based in San Francisco that enables
            better career outcomes for hourly workers by providing a transparent and efficient labor marketplace.
            At <a href="https://www.workstep.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WorkStep</a>, we used
            MySQL/Memcached for our data storage, Python/WebApp2 for our APIs, and React/Redux/Redux Saga for our view layer.
            I worked across all parts of the application and helped re-architect our employer interview scheduling feature,
            and was a major contributor to the new employer self-service flow, which doubled our customer success teams
            productivity (measured in time spent onboarding new employer customers).

          <p>
            <i>
              "If I'm an advocate of anything, it's to move. As far as you can, as much as you can. Across the ocean, or simply across the river.
              The extent to which you can walk in someone else's shoes or at least eat their food, it's a plus for everybody. Open your mind,
              get up off the couch, move."

          <p>
            <i>- Anthony Bourdain</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2. Least favorite quote?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>
              "If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship, you don't ask what seat. You just get on."
            </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>- Sheryl Sandberg</i>
          </p>
          <p>
            Wrong. You don't blindly get on a rocket ship when you don't know who built it, who's flying it, who else is on it, where it's going, and how much fuel is in the tank.
          </p>

            <b>3. Book smart or street smart?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Book smart.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>4. Morning or afternoon meetings?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Afternoon. Mornings are best spent with a cup of black coffee (or if it's Philz, a Silken Splendor - Philz Way) and NO distractions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>5. How would you sell hot chocolate in Florida?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a sales question, and I'm NOT a sales person. It's not my job to convince (or trick) customers into believing they
            need a product when they clearly don't. That said, this question assumes that people in Florida don't want
            hot chocolate, which simply isn't true. Soooooo... we'd sell normally, collect data, analyze that data, and then
            focus on our customers at the edges (those who hate our product and those who love our product). It's then my job as an engineer
            to reiterate on our product (do we change the recipe? do we change the cup we sell it in? etc). We then start the process
            over again.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wholeheartedly believe there are products for which there is no market for regardless of how great the team is who built it.
